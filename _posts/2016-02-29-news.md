Hot off the presses! The latest CD from the fantastic _Couloir, _featuring my work_Serere, _alongside [Nico Muhly's][0]_Clear Music. _Official release in May. 

In 2015 Restless Productions took our full-length dance and music production _"The Moment of Forgetting"_ to [Artspring][1], on Saltspring Island. It was a fantastic experience. Myself and co-Artistic Director Claire French revised the work from the ground up, with wonderful results, literally bringing the audience to its feet! 

I also premiered a new work, for dancer and cello solo---again with Claire French---at [EDAM Dance][2], called _"Based on a True Story"_. The piece was premiered by dancer [Caitlin Griffin][3] and cellist [Marina Hasselberg][4]. 

Works in progress include a new piece for 8 electric guitars(!) for Redshift Music's "Vertical Orchestra" 2016, a duo for clarinet and flute, with electronics for NuBC. Upcoming works include a double concerto for [Couloir][5] (Ariel Barnes: cello and Heidi Krutzen: harp) and [Turning Point Ensemble][6], and a work for 6 brass and 8 percussion for Instruments of Change and Music on Main.
