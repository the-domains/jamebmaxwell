Hot off the presses! The latest CD of the fantastic _Couloir, _featuring my work_Serere, _alongside [Nico Muhly's][0]_Clear Music. _Official release in May. 

In 2015 Restless Productions took our full-length dance and music production "The Moment of Forgetting" to [Artspring][1], on Saltspring Island. It was a fantastic experience, for which myself and co-Artistic Director Claire French revised the work for the ground up, with wonderful result---literally bringing the audience to its feet. I also premiered a new work, again with Claire French, at [EDAM Dance][2], called "Based on a True Story" for dancer and cello solo. The piece was premiered by dancer [Caitlin Griffin][3] and cellist [Marina Hasselberg][4]. Works in progress include a new piece for 8 electric guitars(!) for Redshift Music's "Vertical Orchestra" 2016, a duo for clarinet and flute, with electronics for NuBC. Upcoming works include a double concerto for Couloir (Ariel Barnes: cello and Heidi Krutzen: harp) and Turning Point Ensemble, and a work for 6 brass and 8 percussion for Instruments of Change and Music on Main.
