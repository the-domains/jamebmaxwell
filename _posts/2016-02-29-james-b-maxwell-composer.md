James Maxwell is a composer of concert music and music for contemporary dance, theatre, film, and media, and is Co-Artistic Director of Restless Productions. Maxwell studied composition in Vancouver with Owen Underhill, David MacIntyre, Barry Truax, and Ladislav Kubik, and recently earned his PhD from Simon Fraser University. He has worked collaboratively with choreographers Claire French, Helen Walkley, Simone Orlando, and Joe Laughlin, director Mallory Catlett, film makers Alex Williams and Alison Beda, writer Caleb Johnson, and visual artists Kathleen Ritter and Hadley+Maxwell. Recent concert works include recurrere and emancipare, commissioned by Music On Main for "The Orpheus Project", and ruduo for flute and piano, commissioned by the Tiresias Duo. Recent works for dance include a re-visioning of Restless' 2012 full-length work The Moment of Forgetting, and Based on a True Story, for dancer and solo cello. Upcoming projects include a new work for 8 electric guitars for Redshift Music's Vertical Orchestra 2016, a new piece for 6 brass and 8 percussion, for Instruments of Change and Music on Main, and a double concerto for Couloir (cello & harp) and large ensemble, for Turning Point Ensemble.

James is also an active researcher and programmer in the field of computer applications for interactive music composition. His doctoral work explored the design and development of computer-assisted composition tools, with a focus on using intelligent, adaptive systems as compositional "collaborators."
